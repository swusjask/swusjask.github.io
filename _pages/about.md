I am Mohammad Ferry Husnil Arif, a Computer Science student at Universitas Indonesia. I got interested in cryptography through CTF competitions because it combines cybersecurity and mathematics. This led me to want to focus on cryptography research. During my studies, I also joined some math competitions including got Third Prize at the International Mathematics Competition 2024.

## Research Interest

I have broad research interests in the **theoretical foundations of cryptography**, particularly **post-quantum cryptography** built on **lattice-based** constructions and related topics in **privacy-preserving computation**. I am open to learning specific areas within cryptography where **theoretical computer science** and **mathematics** are deeply involved.
