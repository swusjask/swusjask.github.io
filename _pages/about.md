I am Mohammad Ferry Husnil Arif, a recent Computer Science graduate from Universitas Indonesia. I became interested in cryptography through CTF competitions, where I saw how abstract mathematics underlies real world security, and this gradually led me toward theoretical cryptography at the interface of mathematics and computer science.

## Research Interest

I came to **cryptography** through my interest in **algebra** and **number theory**, where objects like groups, elliptic curves, isogenies, and lattices lattices. This has drawn to more foundational questions, such as which hardness assumptions and models are needed for primitives like **proof systems** and other cryptographic constructions, especially in the standard model and against quantum adversaries. More broadly, I enjoy the theoretical computer science side of cryptography and am building my background in **complexity theory** and **quantum computing**, both to understand their impact on cryptographic assumptions and for the complexity theoretic questions they raise on their own. In particular, I am interested in recent work in **quantum cryptography** based on problems beyond NP, whose security could in principle persist even in a hypothetical world where NP = P.
