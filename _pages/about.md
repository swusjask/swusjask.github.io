I am Mohammad Ferry Husnil Arif, a recent Computer Science graduate from Universitas Indonesia. I got interested in cryptography through CTF competitions because they combine cybersecurity and mathematics, which led me to focus on cryptography research.

## Research Interest

I have broad research interests in **cryptography**, from the **foundations of cryptography** to practical **privacy-preserving systems**. I am particularly interested in foundational questions such as which hardness assumptions on lattices suffice for secure computation and proof systems while remaining secure in the post-quantum setting. I am open to learning specific areas within cryptography where **theoretical computer science** and **mathematics** are deeply involved
